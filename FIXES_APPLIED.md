# Fixes Applied to PG-View

## Issue Summary
The codebase had several critical issues preventing proper execution of views and queries, especially for virtual views without explicit CONSTRUCT clauses.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Command Parsing - Trailing Spaces Bug (CommandExecutor.java)
**Problem**: Lines ending with semicolons followed by spaces (e.g., `); `) were not recognized as command terminators, causing multiple commands to be concatenated into one.

**Fix** (line 148, 153):
- Changed `line.equals("")` to `line.trim().equals("")`
- Changed `line.substring(line.length()-1, line.length()).equals(";")` to `line.trim().endsWith(";")`

**Impact**: Commands are now properly separated and executed individually.

---

### 2. PostgreSQL Table Creation (Postgres.java)
**Problem**: `ANALYZE N_g` and `ANALYZE E_g` commands were executed before these tables existed, causing errors during initialization.

**Fix** (lines 86-109, 168-250):
- Wrapped `stmt.execute("analyze N_g")` and `stmt.execute("analyze E_g")` in try-catch blocks
- Silently ignores PSQLException when tables don't exist yet

**Impact**: Database initialization no longer fails with "relation does not exist" errors.

---

### 3. PostgreSQL Schema Creation (PostgresStore.java)
**Problem**: Base schemas (`N_g`, `E_g`, `NP_g`, `EP_g`, catalog tables) were not being created when a new database was initialized.

**Fix** (lines 940-1010):
- Uncommented the loop that calls `createSchema(name, p)` for all base predicates
- Ensures all required base tables are created during `createDatabase()`

**Impact**: New databases now have all required base tables for storing graph data.

---

### 4. PostgreSQL Index Creation (PostgresStore.java)
**Problem**: Re-running scripts would fail with "relation already exists" errors when trying to create indexes.

**Fix** (lines 112-164):
- Added `IF NOT EXISTS` clause to all `CREATE INDEX` statements
- Modified both `addTableIndex(String name, ArrayList<Integer> cols)` and `addTableIndex(Predicate p, ArrayList<String> cols)` methods

**Impact**: Scripts can be re-run without dropping the database first.

---

### 5. PostgreSQL View Creation (PostgresStore.java)
**Problem**: Re-running scripts would fail when views already existed.

**Fix** (lines 711-837):
- Added `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ... CASCADE` before `CREATE VIEW` statements
- Added `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS GENNEWID_MAP CASCADE` in `createConstructors()` (lines 1443-1508)
- Added `IF NOT EXISTS` to `CREATE INDEX` for `newid_vrm_idx`

**Impact**: Views can be recreated cleanly without manual cleanup.

---

### 6. **CRITICAL FIX**: Auto-Enable DEFAULT MAP for Selection Views (ViewParser.java)
**Problem**: Views with only MATCH clauses (no CONSTRUCT/MAP/ADD/DELETE) did not have `N_viewname` and `E_viewname` relations created, but queries on these views tried to access them, resulting in "relation does not exist" errors.

**Root Cause**: `isDefaultMap` was only set to `true` when `WITH DEFAULT MAP` was explicitly present in the view definition. For selection-only views, this flag was `false`, so `addViewRules()` was never called, and the essential N/E relations were never created.

**Fix** (lines 85-112):
```java
boolean hasConstruct = false;
for (int i = 0; i < ctx.view_definition().trans_rule().size(); i++) {
    // ... parse TransRule ...
    
    // Check if this rule has CONSTRUCT, MAP, ADD, or DELETE clauses
    if (transRule.getPatternConstruct().size() > 0 || 
        transRule.getMapFromToMap().size() > 0 ||
        transRule.getPatternAdd().size() > 0 ||
        transRule.getPatternRemove().size() > 0 ||
        transRule.getEdgeVarsToDelete().size() > 0 ||
        transRule.getNodeVarsToDelete().size() > 0) {
        hasConstruct = true;
    }
}

// If view has only MATCH (no CONSTRUCT/MAP/ADD/DELETE), automatically enable default map
if (!hasConstruct && !transRuleList.isDefaultMap()) {
    System.out.println("[ViewParser] View has only MATCH clause, automatically enabling DEFAULT MAP");
    transRuleList.setDefaultMap(true);
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Selection views (MATCH-only) now work correctly on all backends
- Queries like `MATCH ... FROM viewname RETURN ...` now execute successfully
- Users no longer need to manually add `WITH DEFAULT MAP` for simple selection views
- Fixes the fundamental issue that prevented virtual views from being queried

## Testing Results

All test scenarios now pass:

1. **PostgreSQL with virtual view**: 2 results ✓
2. **SimpleDatalog with virtual view**: 1 result ✓  
3. **Simple view test (test_02)**: 2 results ✓
4. **Default map test (test_11)**: 1 result ✓
5. **Database reuse**: Works with warning message ✓

## Key Improvements

1. **Robustness**: Scripts can be run multiple times without manual cleanup
2. **Correctness**: Views are now properly created with all required relations
3. **Usability**: Selection views work intuitively without requiring explicit `WITH DEFAULT MAP`
4. **Compatibility**: All backends (PostgreSQL, SimpleDatalog, LogicBlox) benefit from these fixes
